# Clicky Game

Clicky Game is a front-end application created using React.js.  It demonstrates the benefits of React such as:

* Reusable Components
* Use of a Virtual DOM
* JSX Syntax  

See the deployed site [here](https://aqueous-ocean-25661.herokuapp.com/).

The goal of the game is to click on each image once.  The images will randomize in order after each click.  The game ends when an image is clicked more than once.
